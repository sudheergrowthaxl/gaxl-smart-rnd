        "value": "<b>Eaton XT IEC Power Control Family | XT Series — Reversing & Non-reversing Vacuum Contactors | Power Control 580 to 2600 A:</b><br /><br />The XT ICE Series contactors use an electronic coil interface design that allows for flexibility in switching and greater reliability. These high-amperage contactors can be switched conventionally with full power to the coil, directly from a PLC output, or from a low-power command device. Low pickup and sealing power generates less heat and reduces the investment in control power transformers. The three switching tubes and electromechanical drive system of the XT 580–2600A contactors are arranged in an extremely compact design. This allows for smaller switchgear dimensions, while switching higher currents—up to 2600A.The XT IEC series includes non-reversing and reversing contactors and starters as well as overload relays and accessories. Enclosed control options include metallic and non-metallic enclosures with circuit breakers, and North American or European fuses. The XT line of IEC motor control is not the same as traditional motor control designs. XT was designed to be engineered better.<br /><br /><b>Family Features:</b><br /><li> Toolless assembly of manual motor controllers and reversing contactors<br /><li> Low coil consumption<br /><li> Front accessibility to coil terminations<br /><li> Built-in surge suppression on electronic coils<br /><li> Built-in auxiliary contact for contactors up to 32A in a 45 mm frame<br /><li> Finger-safe and back-of-hand proof ratings<br /><li> Direct PLC control on 185A–2000A contactors<br /><br /><b>The XT Family line includes a large offering of power control components and accessories that cover a broad range of applications and ratings:</b><br /><li> Three-pole contactors to 2000A<br /><li> Four-pole contactors to 200A<br /><li> Capacitor contactors to 680 kVAR<br /><li> Mini contactors to 9A<br /><li> Relays to 16A<br /><li> Thermal overload relays to 630A<br /><li> Electronic overload relays to 1500A<br /><li> Manual motor protectors to 65A<br /><li> Manual motor controllers and combination motor controllers to 65A<br /><br /><b>Additional Information:</b><br />— Electronic coil controller allows contactors to reduce power consumption and generate less heat, resulting in lower cooling requirements, the ability to mount more contactors/starters per cabinet, and an extended life on pilot devices that carry control signals.<br />— AC and DC devices with the same dimensions achieved with an electronically controlled coil system allow for space savings and reduced engineering design time.<br />— Integrated suppressors in DC controlled contactors offers reductions in total logistics and inventory costs by limiting the number of products ordered and stocked.<br />— Wiring is not required, therefore increasing installation and maintenance efficiency.<br />— Expanded range of DC coil control voltages, allows reliable operation through fluctuations in control voltages.<br />— Twin terminals with separate sockets in contactors up to 400A offer installation and application flexibility when using different size wires. The improved integrity of the connections reduces cabling faults.",
